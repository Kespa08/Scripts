  cell_grid:
    columns: [A, B, C, D, E]           # Defined by vertical guides GUIDE_xA through GUIDE_xF
    rows: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]              # Defined by horizontal guides GUIDE_y1 through GUIDE_y6
    notes:
      - Guides must already exist in the document
      - Profile never creates or deletes guides
      - Columns are spaces between vertical guides (A = space between xA and xB)
      - Rows are spaces between horizontal guides (1 = space between y1 and y2)
