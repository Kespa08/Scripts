# APPROVED OBJECT INVENTORY
# Each object includes an ID and spatial hints for Phase 2 construction planning.
# Spatial hints reduce information entropy at the Phase 1→2 boundary by preserving
# the agent's spatial interpretation so positions don't need to be re-derived from the image.

objects:
  AREA: []
    # Example:
    # - id: AREA_Furniture__001
    #   cell_hint: "C1:F2"          # Approximate cell range from image analysis
    #   spatial_note: "top center, large table spanning 4 columns"
    # - id: AREA_Furniture__002
    #   cell_hint: "F1:H2"
    #   spatial_note: "top right, adjacent to AREA_Furniture__001"

  ICON: []
    # Example:
    # - id: ICON_Staff__001
    #   cell_hint: "G4"
    #   spatial_note: "right side of workstation grid, row 4"
    # - id: ICON_Chair__001
    #   cell_hint: "E5"
    #   spatial_note: "within workstation grid"

  COMP: []
    # Example:
    # - id: COMP_RegionPigeonhole__001
    #   cell_hint: "C3:C4"
    #   spatial_note: "left column of pigeonhole array"

  LABEL: []
    # Example:
    # - id: LABEL__A
    #   cell_hint: "A1"

    # Example:
    # - id: PATH_Perimeter__001

# COLOR ZONE MAPPING
# Objects generated from color highlights

# GROUPINGS (if identified)
# Optional: Major spatial groupings for construction reference

# COUNTS (for verification)
# Note: COMP children are NOT counted separately — only the parent COMP counts.
