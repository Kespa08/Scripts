# === GLOBAL RULES ===
authoritative_sources:
  - "# Coordinate Placement Spec v1.yaml"
  - "LayoutProfile_v1.yaml"
  - "User-confirmed mapping decisions (2026-02-04)"

fixed_document_rules:
  keep_guides_unchanged: true
  keep_layers_unchanged: true
  overlap_allowed: true
  strict_cell_grid_required: false
  follow_illustrator_layout_logic: true
   
  text_in_reference_images:
    policy: referential_only
    rule: "Do not render words/sentences from the source image unless the object is a LABEL_* object."
# === ANALYSIS PROTOCOL ===
# CRITICAL: Follow this exact sequence to avoid visual hierarchy bias

analysis_sequence:
  step_1_baseline_count:
    action: "Count and catalog ALL gray rectangles first, before processing any other visual elements"
    output_required: "List of AREA_Furniture__001 through __NNN with spatial locations"
    rule: "Complete this step entirely before proceeding to step 2"
    rationale: "Gray rectangles are easiest to miss when highlights/text draw attention"
  
  step_2_color_semantics:
    action: "Identify and count all color highlights (orange, green, blue, purple)"
    output_required: "Color highlight inventory with counts"
    rule: "Do not interpret what highlights mean yet, just count them"
  
  step_3_icons_and_symbols:
    action: "Identify all person icons, symbols, and simple graphics"
    output_required: "Icon inventory with spatial locations"
  
  step_4_text_labels:
    action: "Catalog all text elements and map to object types"
    output_required: "Text-to-object mappings"
  
  step_5_compositions:
    action: "Identify multi-part compositions"
    output_required: "Composition inventory"
  
  step_6_cross_reference:
    action: "Verify counts match across categories (e.g., 4 pigeonhole labels = 4 furniture units)"
    output_required: "Consistency check report"

# === MANDATORY CHECKS ===
systematic_counting_rules:
  gray_rectangles:
    scan_pattern: "Top-to-bottom, left-to-right systematic sweep"
    verification: "After initial count, re-scan to confirm no rectangles were visually merged or overlooked"

  large_shapes_furniture:
    scan_pattern: "Top-to-bottom, left-to-right systematic sweep"
    identification_criteria:
      primary: "Size and proportion (large geometric shapes)"
      not: "Color value"
    rule: "Each distinct large rectangle/shape = one AREA_Furniture__* object"
    common_errors_to_avoid:
      - "Treating multiple stacked rectangles as one unit"
      - "Ignoring rectangles that contain other visual elements (text, highlights, icons)"
      - "Missing rectangles in visually busy areas"
    
  within_highlighted_zones:
    rule: "Color highlights (green, blue) may CONTAIN furniture/objects - always check interior"
    example: "A green zone outline may contain 4 gray tables inside it"
    action: "Explicitly count furniture WITHIN zone boundaries"
  
  baseline_before_inference:
    rule: "Complete physical object count (furniture, icons) before mapping to semantic types (COMP, LABEL)"
    rationale: "Prevents skipping objects that seem 'already accounted for' by text labels"
  
# === INPUT INTERPRETATION ===
color_semantics:
  template:
    rule: "If x highlights detected → infer x candidates of specified type"
  
  definitions:
    orange_highlight:
      meaning: "LABEL"
      target_type: "LABEL__*"
      example_count: 3
      example_output: ["LABEL__A", "LABEL__B", "LABEL__C"]
    
    green_highlight:
      meaning: "Dot zone area"
      target_type: "AREA_DotZone__*"
      example_count: 2
      example_output: ["AREA_DotZone__001", "AREA_DotZone__002"]

    purple_highlight:
      meaning: "Square zone area"
      target_type: "AREA_SquareZone__*"
      example_count: 2
      example_output: ["AREA_SquareZone__001", "AREA_SquareZone__002"]

    blue_highlight:

      example_count: 3
      example_output: ["AREA_StorageUnit__001", "AREA_StorageUnit__002", "AREA_StorageUnit__003"]

  unknown_highlight:
      rule: "If a highlight color is detected that does not match any defined color semantic, stop and prompt the user for clarification."

  connector_lines:
    create: false
    notes:
      - "Flow/connector lines are currently non-semantic and must be ignored."

# Object Identification Schema
# Purpose: Map visual elements in supplied images to Illustrator file objects

category_definitions:
  label:
    description: "Text that conveys semantic information"
    characteristics:
      - "Primary content is readable text"
      - "May have thin border or no border"
      - "Describes function, location, or contents"
    examples: ["Team Leader", "Entry/Exit", "Pigeonholes (district)"]
  
  icon:
    description: "Small symbolic graphics with conventional meaning"
    size_characteristic: "Small relative to furniture areas"
    characteristics:
      - "Simple, recognizable symbol"
      - "Typically small relative to overall composition"
      - "Universally understood visual shorthand"
    examples: ["person silhouette", "wheelchair symbol", "arrows", "envelope"]
  
  area:
    description: "Shapes representing physical objects or spatial zones"
    characteristics:
      - "Large geometric shapes (rectangles, squares)"
      - "Represents furniture, equipment, or boundaries"
      - "May contain labels or icons within"
      - "Typically solid fill or outline"
    visual_markers:
      - "Solid fill"
      - "Outlined borders"
      - "NOT dependent on specific color value"
    size_characteristic: "Large relative to icons/symbols"
    critical_rule: "Count EVERY large rectangle/shape as potential furniture, regardless of fill color"
    examples: ["tables", "room perimeter", "furniture units"]
    critical_rule: "Count EVERY gray rectangle as separate furniture object, regardless of what else it contains"
    counting_priority: 1  # Must be counted FIRST before other object types

  composition:
    description: "Multi-element pictorial compositions depicting functional units"
    characteristics:
      - "Multiple connected shapes forming coherent whole"
      - "Depicts complete functional arrangement"
      - "More complex than single icon or area"
    examples: ["workstation with monitors and chair", "voting compartment array"]


classification_priority:
  - "If element is primarily text → label"
  - "If element is simple recognizable symbol → icon"
  - "If element is multi-part pictorial composition → composition"
  - "If element is geometric shape representing physical object → area"
